      <description>June Welsh, KF6WPQ, was a tireless volunteer for the Mountain View CERT Program and the Amateur Radio Emergency Service. For nearly 15 years she was the voice of the SPEC 220/440 net on Monday nights, and was the principle logistical support for the County ARES/RACES training sessions, for the SPECS annual meeting and the Flea Market. She will be sorely missed.
