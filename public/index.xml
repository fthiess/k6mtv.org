      <description>Donna Gandour, KK6LUA, has made 5 short audio recordings of call signs slowly announced phonetically in groups that follow the same manner used for our Monday night nets. You can listen to the recordings and practice writing down the call signs, and if you wish, also check them off on the pre-formatted log sheet also linked below.

      <description>Qualifications Experience and Training Mountain View ARES/RACES provides opportunities for licensed ham radio operators to increase their skills and knowledge in communication networks and emergency preparedness.
There are several types of opportunities available for newcomers to gain experience in network communications, outlined below.
Weekly Nets Every Monday night Mountain View ARES/RACES members participate in a local city &amp;ldquo;net&amp;rdquo; that&amp;rsquo;s part of the weekly SPECS Net. During a net, participants tune their radios to the same frequency and listen to a &amp;ldquo;net control&amp;rdquo; operator read announcements and ask participants to check-in.</description>

      <description>In response to the county ARES Communication Exercise, Mountain View did an &amp;ldquo;off the grid&amp;rdquo; exercise where everyone, including operators in the Radio Room at K6MTV operated their systems off batteries. Some participants traveled to CERT sites and recovered hidden messages to transmit. Other participants used their home packet system operating on battery power to send/receive messages. Operators at K6MTV also responded to messages from the County. There were 14 participants (radio room 4, mobile field 4, home packet 6).</description>

In 2019 our members participated in 4 Mountain View classes, 4 county exercises, 4 city events and 2 city-wide CERT exercises, plus attending county classes.

      <description>These are instructions for adding the revised Mountain View DA Summary form to an existing installation of Outpost.
The current version of Outpost, Installer 145C, can be found here and this version or later should be installed on your computer before installing the files described below. The 145C installer results in a version of Outpost that reports &amp;ldquo;Version 3.3.0 c65&amp;rdquo; when run. The Damage Assessment Summary form is still in PacFORMS format and will remain that way.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this class was to introduce Outpost Packet operation to hams new to packet with a two fold objective: Introduce Packet operation with the hope that they would contine training with the county classes and to provide them with enough skills with Outpost so that they could relieve a trained packet operator for a breif period of time during an exercise or real emergency.
The class had 14 attendees: 1 presenter, 4 instructor/mentors, 9 students.</description>

      <description>I want to thank Rick Van Mell, KI6PUR, for cordinating the Mike-Mike drill Saturday. There were a total of 18 people participating inclucing the 5 of us in the &amp;ldquo;shack&amp;rdquo;. Rick sent 84 emails inviting Mountain View hams to participate in the drill, so the response was somewhat dissapointing. However, those who took the time to send us one or more Mike-Mike reports did a great job. The reports were generally well distributed around Mountain View.</description>

For nearly 15 years she was the voice of the SPEC 220/440 net on Monday nights, and was the principle logistical support for the County ARES/RACES training sessions, for the SPECS annual meeting and the Flea Market. She will be sorely missed.
