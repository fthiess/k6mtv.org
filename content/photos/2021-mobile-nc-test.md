## Test Setup of Mobile Net Control, July 17, 2021

After the Pandemic, this was the first event where we were able to gather to test setting
up equipment for our mobile Net Control Command Center.

Over the past couple of years, with major effort of Leslie Grimm, Emergency Coordinator of Mountain View
ARES, has acquired equipment to enable us to build a mobile ARES Net Control command center in the event
our radio shack at 1000 Villa was not available. This equipment included a pop-up tent, radios,
tables, chairs, antenna stands, a laptop computer and printer, a solar powered battery system, cables,
etc.

On Saturday, July 17, 2021, those in the picture gathered in Forrest's back patio to set up the
equipment and test it out, including the Fire Station 5 mobile packet station. We asked our ARES members
throughout the city for help in testing out how well our antenna system could reach across Mountain View,
and nine of our hams volunteered. We tested using the 440.8 MHz repeater and our primary simplex frequency.
We did discover that simplex was not good for some areas, but with the help of AEC Paul Goldstein, acting
as a relay from his home, we were able to communicate satisfactorily. The one AEC missing was Jim Weatherford
who was on assignment.

The pictures that follow show roughly the sequence of our setup and shutdown. Forrest
had a security camera that recorded [this timelapse video of the exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73Sy3E_36Ic).
