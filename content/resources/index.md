## Mountain View ARES/RACES Emergency Plan

The [Mountain View ARES Emergency Plan (2019-11-24)](static/docs/mtv-emergency-plan-20191124.pdf), describes procedures,
resources, contact persons, and activation procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency.

## Santa Clara County Frequency Lists for Programming Radios

[Santa Clara Co. Frequencies](static/docs/MTV-ARES-Frequencies-20150228.xls)---These frequencies are organized by City in Santa Clara County and were prepared by Jerry Haag (SK) to match the order of frequencies programmed into the radios in the ARES shack in Mountain view. The format is Excel, XLS.

[Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties frequencies](static/docs/SCC-SMC-Frequencies.xlsx)---There are two sheets to this Excel (XLSX) file. The first has Santa Clara County frequencies from the County website and they are sorted numerically. The list is separated into Frequently Used, VHF, UHV and Packet. The Frequently used frequencies are repeated in the subsequent sections. The second sheet contains Frequently Used, VHF, UHV and Packet frequencies for San Mateo County. There is no guarantee that I have captured all of the SMC frequencies. Note that both sheets are laid out so that you can print a frequency sheet. You will have to do some re-formating to match your radio programming program requirements. Prepared by [Phil Henderson](mailto:kf6zsq@yahoo.com).

## ARES/RACES Software

The [Outpost Packet Message Manager](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/data/packet/client-software.html) is used
by ARES/RACES members in Santa Clara County to communicate over a
[packet radio network](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/data/packet/packet-service.html). Outpost includes the
ability to send and receive standard forms used throughout the County, but one form that has not yet been
standardized---and so is not included in the default installation of Outpost---is the Damage Assessment (DA)
Summary form used by Mountain View CERT teams to provide the city Emergency Operations Center with damage
information about their neighborhoods.

To meet this need, Phil Henderson (KF6ZSQ) created a fillable PacForm version of the DA Summary form that's compatible with
Outpost, but which needs to be installed manually.

You can find instructions and the files you will need to install the new
form [in this post]({{< ref "news/da-summary-20191106.md" >}}).
