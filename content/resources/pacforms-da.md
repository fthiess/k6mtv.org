This is a single installer for either the private or public version of the Outpost Packet Message Manager to add the Mountain View ARES/CERT Damage Assessement reporting PacFORM to the Outpost Forms drop-down list. You must have installed Outpost from installer 145C or later. The 145C installer results in Outpost Version 3.3.0 c65 displayed when you run Outpost.  The current version of the Outpost installer can be found on [this page](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/data/packet/client-software.html) of the Santa Clara County website.

The install file is similar to that used to install the combined Outpost & PackItForms and Legacy PacFORMS files and places all files in their correct locations.

The installer copies the latest version of the Damage Assessment form to the `C:\PacFORMS\exec` directory and a file called `Launch.local` to the Outpost Data directory. `Launch.local` provides Outpost with the information required to populate the Outpost Forms drop-down menu. An Acrobat version of the DA form is saved to the `C:\PacFORMS\PaperForms` directory.

After downloading and saving the install file to your hard drive, double click on the file and follow instructions. It is required that Outpost is running when this is done. When the installer is completed, restart Outpost and check the Forms drop-down menu and make sure that there is one new PacFORM file at the bottom of the list.
