Mountain View ARES/RACES participates in several nets on Monday nights:

## SPECS Net: Every Monday Night, 20:00-20:30

The [Southern Peninsula Emergency Communications System (SPECS)](http://www.specsnet.org/) meets every Monday night at
20:00 (8:00 PM). [SPECS conducts](https://www.specsnet.org/monday-night-net) two nets on Monday nights, plus a concurrent set of city-specific nets; there's an optional weekly packet practice as well:

- The optional "UHF net" meets from 19:30 to 20:00 on the linked W6ASH repeater UHF frequencies of 224.14 MHz (with
an 88.5 Hz PL tone) and 440.800 MHz (with a 100 Hz PL tone). The UHF net closes when the main net begins.
Visitors are welcome to check-in.

- The main SPECS Net begins at 20:00 on the W6ASH repeater VHF frequencies of 145.270 (with a 100 Hz PL tone). During
this net each city will be told the frequency to immediately switch to for their own local nets.

- The **Mountain View ARES/RACES net** begins immediately after its frequency is announced on the main SPECS
net---usually 146.535 MHz simplex, or our alternate frequency of 147.495 MHz simplex. The net control operator
will ask for check-ins in order of the first letter of each individual's call sign _suffix_ (the suffix is the letter or
letters to the right of the number in the call sign, e.g. the suffix for "K6MTV" is "MTV", so the the operator with
that call sign would check in under "M"). Visitors are welcome to check-in.

- Finally, Santa Clara County ARES/RACES conducts an optional
[weekly packet practice](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/data/packet/weekly-packet-practice.html). Operators
can check in by sending a packet message anytime between the close of the previous week's net and the beginning
of the current week's SPECS net at 20:00.

## Volunteer to Serve as Night Net Control

Participants are invited to serve as control operator during the check-in process, gaining valuable experience
managing a directed net. New net control operators will receive training with the script and check-in roster.
You can sign-up online at [k6mtv.org/net-signup]({{< ref "net-signup" >}}) or by contacting
Phil Henderson (KF6ZSQ) via email at kf6zsq@yahoo.com, or by telephone at 650-961-6802. Net control

## Other Nets in the South Bay Area

For ARES/RACES, the Monday night SPECS Net (see above) covers half the cities in Santa Clara
County, including Mountain View; the cities in the other half of the County participate in the weekly *Tuesday*
night [SVECS Net](http://www.svecs.net/). A breakdown of these and various other nets can be found on the
["Nets" page of the Santa Clara County ARES/RACES website](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/nets.html).

Outside the ARES/RACES community, many amateur radio clubs in the Bay Area often have their own nets that you
can find information about on their websites. Another popular net is the [9 AM Talk Net](http://www.9amtalk.net/),
which is run at 9am Monday through Friday on the N6NFI repeater (145.230 MHz, 100 Hz PL).
