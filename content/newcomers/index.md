## Qualifications

## Experience and Training

[Mountain View ARES/RACES]({{< ref ares-races >}}) provides opportunities for licensed ham radio operators to increase their skills and knowledge in communication networks and emergency preparedness.

There are several types of opportunities available for newcomers to gain experience in network communications, outlined below.

### Weekly Nets

Every Monday night Mountain View ARES/RACES members participate in a local city "net" that's part of the weekly
[SPECS Net](https://www.specsnet.org/). During a net, participants tune their radios to the same frequency and listen
to a "net control" operator read announcements and ask participants to check-in. Participants take turns transmitting
their call signs, which the net control operator acknowledges. These nets give participants an opportunity to practice
working in a "directed net" environment that's commonly used in emergency operations, as well as the chance to verify
their equipment is functioning correctly. Visitors are welcome on our weekly net; more information about how to
participate can be found under the [Nets]({{< ref nets >}}) tab on this website.

### Training

Ham radio is "the hobby made up of a thousand hobbies". Emergency Communications, or EmComm, is one of those sub-hobbies,
and is distinguished in particular from other branches of the hobby not only by the volunteerism and commitment of it's
members, but also by requirements for training and practice. In a real emergency it's critical that everyone not only
has compatible equiplment and knows how to operate it, but that operators know the procedures and protocols needed to
insure communication is effective and meets the needs of the agencies we serve.

Mountain View ARES/RACES, as well as Santa Clara County ARES/RACES, FEMA, and the California Office of Emergency Services,
offer a wide variety of training, from general to specialized, to insure that when the need arises, ARES/RACES members
are ready to step up. Details of these training programs can be found under the [Training]({{< ref training >}}) tab on
this website.

### Practice Drills

During the year field exercises and drills are carried out to sharpen our communications skills and identify areas
for improvement. Under the navigation button for "Calendar" on this website, you will see the extent of these
opportunities. Some of them are specifically for the ARES/RACES network of ham operators and others involve
ARES/RACES and CERT (Community Emergency Response Teams). Drills are held on both the county and city level.
In addition, there are opportunities during the year to participate in activities that employ ham radio
communications in other cities. In the picture to the left, Rudy Bahr, W6OWI, Bob Fishman, K6FSH, and
Hugo Penafiel, KI6VNJ join other hams at a communication station in Cuesta Park on May 15, 2011 during a
city-wide CERT drill.
