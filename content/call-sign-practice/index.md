Donna Gandour, KK6LUA, has made 5 short audio recordings of call signs slowly announced phonetically in groups that follow the same manner used for our Monday night nets.   You can listen to the recordings and practice writing down the call signs, and if you wish, also check them off on the pre-formatted log sheet also linked below.
