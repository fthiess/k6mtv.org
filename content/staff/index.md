# Mountain View ARES/RACES Staff

Mountain View ARES/RACES... is an all volunteer team of more than 70
men and women. We are FCC-licensed amateur radio operators that
provide emergency communications for the City of Mtn. View and local
agencies as a public service. During 2019, ARES volunteers contributed
over 4,000 hours of time to support city and county activities. We do
what we do because we enjoy it! If you live in Mountain View and have an
amateur radio license, come join us! Please contact [Leslie Grimm,
KK6EKN](mailto:kk6ekn@arrl.net), the ARES/RACES Emergency Coordinator.
