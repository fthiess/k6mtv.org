## Description

Everyone came on time and was set up when people arrived. In addition, one
attendee (Keith R) arrived an hour early and helped move tables and chairs into
position. Others paid attention to coffee supply and helped when a second pot
was needed. Refreshments of bagel and cream cheese and fresh grapes were ample.
Some cookies left to us by an event the night before disappeared very quickly…

Total attendance was 25, counting staff. Tests of radios and antennas and
construction of power pole connectors were accomplished well within the
time-frame allowed without the need to have a signup sheet. No one needed radio
programming. Attendees included 3 brand new hams from Mountain View and 3 recent
hams. Mike greeted new arrivals and gave them an overview of activities. We had
4 visitors from Los Altos (new ham with husband, EC who came toward the end, and
one who set up his packet station demonstrating a new design for a “hood”. One
visitor came from one of the nearby hospital crews. Many attendees were
interested and asking questions about the go-kit items on display and the
components of the various packet kits. Mike added two new hams to the database.
Rick, Phil and Leslie got photos for the website.

Dave tested 6 radios. He used the same basic measurement-kit of equipment he
used in previous years, plus one new experiment (using a directional coupler as
a safe RF attenuator) and it all worked out fine and met the needs.

Antenna analyzer:

- Forrest met with 9-10 people. It took about 5-10 minutes per person. 7 wanted
  printouts. It took about 5-10 minutes per person, depending on the number of
  antennas they wanted to test (most were 1, but several had 2, and one person
  had 4---so around 15 tests run, total), how many questions they had, and how
  much they wanted to chat. He thinks there were more people who were curious
  and wanting to understand the ideas behind antenna testing, than there were
  people who came prepared to have testing done (which was fine!). 2-3 people
  just wanted to talk and hadn't been planning on getting testing done, but
  after hearing more about what we were doing, they ran out to their car to get
  an antenna to bring it in to test.

- Poul – no tests – Forrest had no trouble handling all the tests.

## For Next TIme

- Antenna testers need cookie sheet (ground plane) for magmounts
- Antenna test: suggest to zoom in on one band at a time, to get a more accurate
  display.
- Have labeler available to label new people’s radios etc.
- No need for signups for antenna and radio tests – at most only one person was
  waiting at any one time.
- Assign one person to greet new arrivals and give them an overview of
  activities
- Maybe more publicity: for example, list it on the scc-ares-races.org site as
  an event open to everyone.
- Use the event for recruiting: advertise it to the CERT mailing list. Even if
  they're not hams, I think they might be interested (and if we wanted to use it
  for recruiting, we could design it to be more interesting to them, too).
- Improve the arrangement of tables (which was mostly based on the original
  classroom setup) to make movement around the room less awkward. Maybe move
  most of the setups to the edges of room?  Make a map of table arrangement
  ahead of time---some need power, some need high ceiling for antennas.
- Have literature on who we are, how to get started, and upcoming events
  available for new and prospective hams.
