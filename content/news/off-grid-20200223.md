In response to the county ARES Communication Exercise, Mountain View did an "off the grid" exercise where everyone, including operators in the Radio Room at K6MTV operated their systems off batteries. Some participants traveled to CERT sites and recovered hidden messages to transmit. Other participants used their home packet system operating on battery power to send/receive messages. Operators at K6MTV also responded to messages from the County. There were 14 participants (radio room 4, mobile field 4, home packet 6).

Amateur operators sent/received 67 messages by voice. 96 messages were sent by packet of which 46 were delivered before time ran out  Operators successfully coped with the "loss" of our primary BBS. Forms were correctly completed by all participants and all but one participant were able to complete all of their assignments. Traffic was non-stop and we had to deal with outside groups interfering with our simplex frequencies but our operators handled it well. All the participants acted professionally and correctly completed their ICS forms (214, 213, 213 DA, 309, 211). Everyone was able to operate from their batteries for the entire drill. We learned what needs improvement for the future.
