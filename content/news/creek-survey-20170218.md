On February 18, 2017, we participated in the county wide drill, and our drill was to do a survey of the Stevens and Permanente Creeks at prescribed survey locations and record the real status of the creeks. The goals were to report the status of the information via simplex and repeater radios to net control and take pictures up and down stream. Mountain View CERT members were invited to assist as observers. The photographic results at each survey location can be viewed at this URL: Creek Survey Pictures.
