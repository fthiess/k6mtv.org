### Trailblazer, Sunday morning, September 25, held at Shoreline Park

We are looking forward to supporting the Trailblazer Run/Walk this year. It was virtual for the past two years, but it will be “live” at Shoreline Park on Sunday morning, September 25. This event includes a 5k walk, 5k run, and 10k run.

Operators will be needed at Net control (under a canopy near the parade start/finish), at water stops and mile markers, and as a bike sweep.

Net control will be at the Microsoft Campus on La Avenida and the rest of us will be at mile markers and water stops along the route. We’ll also need 3 people on bikes to follow the last runners in. All volunteers will need a hand-held radio that can hit the 440 repeater (4 to 5 Watt HT). A headset or speaker mic is also helpful. Setup will start about 7am and we are usually done around 11am.

You can signup for the event [here](http://www.k6mtv.org/events/TrailB-Signup.html).

More-detailed instructions will be sent to those who sign up.

Please let me know if you have questions. It’s a very busy time and we’ll need lots of help!
