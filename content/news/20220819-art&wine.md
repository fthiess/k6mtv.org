Here is a new opportunity to practice using our radios!

We will need operators for each of four shifts: Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon, Sunday morning, and Sunday afternoon. Please reserve one of those times (or any other time on one of those days that works for you).

You can signup for the event [here](https://www.k6mtv.org/events/MVAW-Signup.html).
