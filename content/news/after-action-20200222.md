## Description

The scenario was a severe wind and rainstorm causing flooding and power
outages. Hams were dispatched to the radio room and four fire stations. Fire
station teams had one packet operator who tested the computer battery
and connectivity to the 4 BBSs. The voice operator at the fire station
transmitted ICS 213s by voice. One 213 could also be sent by packet.
Optionally, packet and voice operators could trade places and send a text
message by packet and a new voice 213 message.

## Participants

There were four operators at K6MTV---two for packet and county
communications, one net control, and one scribe/shift supervisor. At each
of the four fire stations there were two operators---one packet and one voice.
They were using the packet kit in the fire station and their own HT.

## Results

Fire Station packet operators completed tests on the computer batteries
and connectivity to four BBSs. Voice operators sent 2--4 ICS 213 messages
on storm-related incidents. Participants completed the required forms---211,
214, 213, 309---and turned them in at drill end. Refer to the file: After Action
Notes for more details. **Copy from Feb 26 email**

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### What worked

Operators met or exceeded the objectives for the drill. They came
prepared with the necessary equipment and forms and transmitted
messages accurately, following correct procedures. They problem-solved
to overcome problems with the radios and identified equipment problems
that need to be fixed. Two people were needed to handle county comms
so the shift supervisor took one position and the scribe assumed shift
supervisor role when needed (which wasn’t often).

### What didn’t work; needs improvement

- Several Operators didn’t complete the 214 correctly. This can be addressed
by a short illustrated training document highlighting how certain fields
should be completed.
- Net Control tried using a single form to record travel info and health &
welfare during the drill. It was inadequate---Recommendation is to have
one form for travel that adds names and info as they check in and a
separate form where team members are listed in groups -- Ie, the two
members of FS-1 would be the first two lines, the two members of FS-2
would be listed next, etc.
- Switching connections on du/tri-plexors was a first-time experience for
operators. They succeeded, but adding training and practice on that skill
would be helpful.
- The name for the tactical net on the 205 didn’t match the name NC called it
when asking people to switch to it. For future, include the commonly-used
name on the 205.
- The Antenna Drop documentation needs to be updated with current
information on equipment and software and best practices to use when
entering and exiting the fire station.
- Pre-drill instructions were adequate, but some were sent more than once
without an indication of version. Suggestion is also to send the full set as
the final mailing.
- For ease of planning for future drills it is suggested that a set of standard
scripts and forms be included on the k6mtv website.
