The purpose of this class was to introduce Outpost Packet operation to hams new to packet with a two fold objective: Introduce Packet operation with the hope that they would contine training with the county classes and to provide them with enough skills with Outpost so that they could relieve a trained packet operator for a breif period of time during an exercise or real emergency.

The class had 14 attendees: 1 presenter, 4 instructor/mentors, 9 students. Five packet stations and antennas were set up in the auditorium at 1000 Villa. Following a slide presentation on the components of a packet system and Outpost, the class broke into small groups with an instructor/mentor for every 2 or 3 students. The students practiced setting up outpost and sending and receiving informal and formal messages to various bulletin board systems. By the end of the class all nine students were successfully using packet to send and receive messages.
