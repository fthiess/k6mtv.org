Mountain View ARES will be holding a drill on Saturday, Feb. 19, 2022, from 10 am to noon. We will be operating from our homes, simulating message passing during a major rain/wind storm. Radio Operators will pass messages as if they were at a CERT neighborhood Command Post. There will be a simulated radio room (MTV EOC) communicating to the county as well as to operators at simulated CERTs.

This will be a credentialed drill, meaning that Operators will use standard ICS forms (205, 211, 213, 214, 309). We wonâ€™t be making use of the resource net for travel, since operators will work from home.

Please sign up as a Voice or Packet Operator on [the County website](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/activities/eventdetail.php?id=1199)
