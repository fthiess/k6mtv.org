A new year is almost upon us, and it's a good time to look over your equipment to be sure you'll be ready when you’re needed. Come to our annual Antenna Party Saturday, Jan. 18, from 10am to noon at 1000 Villa. We will have antenna and radio analyzers so you can find out how accurate your equipment is. There will be examples of Go-Kits to give you ideas on what you might want to include in your own kit. There will be tools and parts so you can make your own Anderson Power Pole connectors for your batteries and radios. If you’re interested in packet, there will be examples of several types of packet stations, from simple ones with an HT and magmount antenna to more "high-end" stations with tall antennas, long-lasting batteries, and a printer. And you’ll get to meet other Mountain View operators and exchange ideas.

 Sign up now at k6mtv.org on the links/resources page. We look forward to seeing you!
