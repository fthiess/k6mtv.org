## The Scenario

This drill was held in conjunction with a County communications drill that ran from 10 am to
noon. We participated in the first two phases of the drill.

## What We Did

Fourteen people participated, 12 from home. We used the W6ASH repeater (145.270 MHz) for
communications between home operators and Net Control (NC), and the County message net for
communications with County Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Packet net used BBS W1XSC. One operator acted as Net
Control at the radio room and one as Packet Operator (see assignments table below).

The operators with a county DSW received an alert a few minutes before 10:00am. Net Control
opened a directed net to collect Mike-Mike reports. At about 10:20 there was supposed to be a
second alert (aftershock), but it didn’t happen. However, operators were directed to simulate
that it had happened and to call in a new report with different observations. There was no
further direction from the County for voice operations, so NC closed the net and released the
home operators. The packet operator checked into the County EOC and sent a (simulated)
Jurisdiction Report and a Mutual Aid Request and checked out of the county packet net at
about 11:00 am.

## What Worked

Everything went very well. Home operators sent reasonable numbers based on the damage
observations they had been given and gave their reports at an even speaking pace so that NC
didn’t need many fills. NC tracked reports and reported to the county in a timely manner and
handled an outside call that had to be redirected to the County resource net.

Prior to the drill, operators were given the frequency to use, the County drill instructions, an
earthquake observation table, and a copy of the Mike-Mike table. Some operators didn’t have
a County DSW, so didn’t get the alert, but they participated as if they had received the alert,
and everyone participated in the second reports even though the alert didn’t come.

## What Could Be Improved

Everything went well for us, but the County alert system failed. The first alert was incomplete
and the second alert never came. We had one City operator join the drill without signing in on
the County website, but that operator followed the instructions as well as the others. The
packet operator was initially uncertain of which BBS to use for the County, but then found that
the address on a drill bulletin was the one to use.
