I want to thank Rick Van Mell, KI6PUR, for cordinating the Mike-Mike drill Saturday. There were a total of 18 people participating inclucing the 5 of us in the "shack". Rick sent 84 emails inviting Mountain View hams to participate in the drill, so the response was somewhat dissapointing. However, those who took the time to send us one or more Mike-Mike reports did a great job. The reports were generally well distributed around Mountain View.

Leslie, KK6EKN, plotted all the places from which we got reports and put a red dot on a map of Mountain View for each one. We got reports on simplex using HT's for almost all. Exceptions were Shoreline and Casey (very far north, received on 440 with an HT) and Piper and Elmira (mobile rig, actually in Sunnyvale). Operators did a good job of covering wide areas of the city.

Again, thanks to those of you who helped today!
