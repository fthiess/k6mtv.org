Boulder County Colorado ARES was activated during the recent fires and supported
communications when most other communications failed. Their After-Action report
was posted in he [ARRL newsletter of January 19, 2022](http://www.arrl.org/arrlletter?issue=2022-01-20#toc01). It is an interesting read to
Show that it is very important to train to handle emergencies.
