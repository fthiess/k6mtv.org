After two years of very few opportunities to practice with our radios we are now seeing several opportunities! The first one is the County/City communications drill on August 27 from 10:00am to 12. Please sign up as soon as possible on [the county website](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/activities/eventdetail.php?id=1255)

The drill will start with an alert, sent out to your email and/or phone a few minutes before 10:00, saying there has been an earthquake. Please check that you are enrolled in [the County alert system](https://emergencymanagement.sccgov.org/AlertSCC). You will radio Mike-Mike reports to the City. There are details about making those reports on the website---please review! Below is the basic scenario. More details will be sent to those who sign up. Two operators will serve at the radio room at 1000 Villa St. and the rest will report from home.

Scenario: Major earthquake followed by aftershock. ARES operators send Mike-Mike reports to City after each shake, and City sends roll-ups to County. Operators will also be reporting simulated jurisdiction status and requesting Mutual Aid (simulated, no actual travel). Most operators will be located at home. The radio room will have a maximum of two operators.
