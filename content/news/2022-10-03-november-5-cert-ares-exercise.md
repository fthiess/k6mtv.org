summary: We will be holding a city-wide CERT exercise on Saturday, November 5,
    from 1:00pm to 5:00pm. ARES will be supporting the CERTs with voice and packet
    radio. At present 9 neighborhood CERTs will be participating, and we like to
    have both a voice and packet operator at each CERT neighborhood as well as a
    team at the ARES command post. It’s an in-person drill, so our operators will
    be going out to the CERT neighborhood Command Posts and taking information from
    the CERTs to relay to the City of Mountain View's Emergency Operations Center
    (EOC). If you are new to this type of exercise we can place you with an
    experienced operator.

We will be holding a city-wide CERT exercise on Saturday, November 5, from 1:00pm to 5:00pm. ARES will be supporting the CERTs with voice and packet radio. At present 9 neighborhood CERTs will be participating, and we like to have both a voice and packet operator at each CERT neighborhood as well as a team at the ARES command post. That means were looking for 20 or more people ideally.

It’s an in-person drill, so our operators will be going out to the CERT neighborhood Command Posts and taking 213s and 213 Damage Summary information from the CERTs to relay to the Mountain View Emergency Operations Center (EOC). If you are new to this type of exercise we can place you with an experienced operator.

It’s a big drill to plan, and it helps to know who can participate well ahead of time. You can sign up now by using the links/resources link at [k6mtv.org](http://k6mtv.org/). Please note whether you will operate by voice, packet, or both. You can also indicate a preferred CERT neighborhood, and any other comments.

Please sign up soon. If you have questions, please email me or phone: 650-969-2349 (doesn’t receive texts).
