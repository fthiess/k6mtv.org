## Santa Clara County ARES/RACES Training Program

[Santa Clara County ARES/RACES](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/) offers a comprehensive set of in-depth classes on radio operation and emergency communications. These classes are listed on the [training page of their website](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/training/ar-courses.html) and cover topics including Field Operations, Net Control, Message Passing, Packet Radio, Cross-Band Repeating, Antennas, Shadowing, and more.

If you're new to emergency communications, the place to start is with the following two classes; they will give you a good grounding and are prerequisites for all other County classes:

1. [Introduction to Emergency Communications](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/training/courses/Intro_to_EmComm/Course_Intro_to_EmComm.html)
2. [Fundamentals of Emergency Communications](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/training/courses/Fund_of_EmComm/Course_Fund_of_EmComm.html)

The current schedule of upcoming classes is available on the [Santa Clara County ARES/RACES Events page](https://www.scc-ares-races.org/activities/events.php).

## Federal and California Emergency Management Courses

In the event of an emergency, FEMA and the State of California have established operational protocols governing how
responders interoperate with each other, including [ICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System),
[NIMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Incident_Management_System), and
[SEMS](https://www.caloes.ca.gov/cal-oes-divisions/planning-preparedness/standardized-emergency-management-system).
Training in these systems is required for responders being deployed to operate in support of emergency
services, including ARES/RACES members.

FEMA and the California Office of Emergency Services provide online classes that explain these emergency management
practices, and provide students with certificates of completion. The recommended classes are:

- [IS-100.c Introduction to Incident Command System](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-100.c)
- [IS-200.c Basic Incident Command System for Initial Response](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-200.c)
- [IS-700.b An Introduction to the National Incident Management System](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-700.b)
- [IS-800.d National Response Framework, An Introduction](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-800.d)
- SEMS G606 Standardized Emergency Management System Introduction; there is no direct link to this class, to access it:

## Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT)

[CERT](https://www.ready.gov/cert) is a volunteer neighborhood disaster preparedness and response program chartered
by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The City of Mountain View's Office of Emergency Services sponsors
about a dozen neighborhood-based CERT teams across the city, and provides an extensive free training program for
volunteers. There is considerable overlap between ARES/RACES and CERT, with ARES/RACES members training together
with CERT, and providing communications between CERT teams in the field and the City of Mountain View Emergency
Operations Center. ARES/RACES members are encouraged to attend CERT training to deepen their own emergency
preparedness and skills, and to further the relationship between the two volunteer organizations.

More information about the Mountain View CERT program and training is available on
[the City's website](https://www.mountainview.gov/depts/fire/preparedness/cert.asp).
