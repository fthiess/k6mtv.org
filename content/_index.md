Mountain View ARES/RACES is a local team of more than 60 volunteer amateur radio operators dedicated to providing
emergency communications support to local, county and state governments during disasters and other emergencies. We
support the Mountain View Police and Fire Departments and provide communications support for local city and charity
events. Last year ARES volunteers donated over 2000 hours to city and county activities.

ARES/RACES volunteers are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission and are trained in emergency
communications procedures. They drill frequently to maintain readiness. Members are also certified in emergency
management protocols, such as the National Incident Management System, and receive training through FEMA courses.
The Mountain View organization operates and maintains K6MTV, a radio station equipped for local and distance
communications located at the Fire Department Headquarters at 1000 Villa Street. Mountain View volunteers provided
important communications support in 2009 after the communication disruption in southern Santa Clara County when a
telephone cable was cut.
