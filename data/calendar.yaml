# Data file from which the calendar of MTV ARES/RACES events is generated

# Events are written in YAML with 4 fields: name, type, date, and time. Example:
# - name: SPECS General Meeting      # Name of event; may also include location and any other useful info (no ":" allowed in name)
#   type: other                      # If "city", "county", "cert", or "react", this will set the color "name" is shown in
#   date: 2020-01-11                 # Date of event; MUST be in YYYY-MM-DD form shown (ISO standard)
#   time: 0900-1200                  # Time of event; may use any form, but form may affect sorting order
#   link: http://specsnet.org        # Optional; if present, the event name will be hyperlinked to this URL
#   update: CHANGED DATE             # Optional; if present, will be printed after name
#   
# Order of events, and fields within an event, don't matter---on the calendar
# they will be sorted by date, then time, then name.

# The "date" field MUST use ISO standard YYYY-MM-DD format. Multi-day events must still list
# a single value in the "date" field. If it's desired to list the additional dates of the
# event, put them in the "name" field.

# Markdown may be used in the "name" field. If you put the name in single quotes
# you can also use emoji from https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/.
# Examples:
#   name: Field Operations **Part A**
#   name: 'Important :boom: event'

# If you use punctuation marks other than comma (",") in a name, the whole name will
# need to be in quotes.

# Colors of event rows are determined by the "type" field. Currently defined
# types: "city" (green), "county" (blue), "cert" (purple), and "react" (orange).

# The optional "update" field, if present, will be printed as-is after the name of the event.
# If the first word of the field is "cancelled", the update text will be colored red.
# If the first word of the field is "new", the update text will be colored green.
# For anything else the update text will be colored orange.
